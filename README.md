# Blood on the Clocktower
A modpack to play Steven Medway's Blood on the Clocktower in Minecraft.

## Installation
On the client side, all players need to do is install the modpack via Modrinth. On the server side, a world must be set up and everything in the ./server folder needs to be dropped into your server's root folder. This is due to configurations for certain mods (TAB, SimpleVoiceChat) being server-side only instead of per-client or per-world.
