# Blood on the Clocktower
A modpack to play Steven Medway's Blood on the Clocktower in Minecraft.

BotC is a social deduction game that will remind you of games like Werewolf or Town of Salem. This modpack is an implementation of the game's mechanics, making it convenient to play with your friends in Minecraft. In order to use this pack, you will need a world set up for it (not included).

Character icons included in this project are from https://github.com/tomozbot/botc-icons/ and used with permission. Game rules are property of The Pandemonium Institute and are not distributed with this modpack, but have graciously been provided for free at Board Game Geek. Other game assets were created by Sybillian for this project specifically.

A list of unimplemented features and issues can be found on this repository's Issues tab.

For private play I am currently using a world only approved for private use, which is not included with the modpack. When this pack is finished, it will include a map on which to play the game. Until then, this pack is meant for play on my server specifically and will not work if you don't have a world set up for it.

## Installation
On the client side, all players need to do is install the modpack via Modrinth. On the server side, a world must be set up and everything in the ./server folder needs to be dropped into your server's root folder. This is due to configurations for certain mods (TAB, SimpleVoiceChat) being server-side only instead of per-client or per-world.
